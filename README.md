# YoloV8-on-Xview-dataset
___________________________________________________________________________
A mini guide how to set up an object detection project using YOLO, we will utilize the dataset located at C:xxxx//xViewv11. 
The training images are organized in the directory idata//train//images, while the validation images are found in idata//valid//images. 
Although the test images are not specified, they could potentially be added later in the idata//test//images directory. The dataset consists of 16 classes, 
each representing different types of vehicles and equipment commonly found on construction sites. 
The classes are: Cement Mixer, Construction Site, Container Crane, Crane Truck, Dump Truck, Engineering Vehicle, Excavator, Front Loader-Bulldozer,
Ground Grader, Haul Truck, Mobile Crane, Pickup Truck, Reach Stacker, Scraper-Tractor, Straddle Carrier, and Tower Crane. 
This structured approach will facilitate effective training and evaluation of the YOLO model for object detection tasks related to construction environments.
